          Holo Sports 2050
        </h1>
        <p class="intro" style="--index: 0; ">
          For the fast forward week we made Holo Sports, for this assignment I had to create something that will be revolutionary in the future. At first, we were struggling to pick between the sports, food and entertainment category.
          So, we looked at which one we liked the most and this was the sports category.

            In this section I will tell you how we started with the research and how we defined the problem.
            When you have read this you will understand how we came to the conclusion and why.

            Trend Analysis <a target="_blank"  href="/docs/CBR/Partout-Debrief.pdf"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
          </h2>  
          <p>
            With the sports category in mind, I started doing research 
            on current problems in sports or things that can help an 
            athlete achieve better results. 
            I used trend analysis for this project to find upcoming 
            technologies that are potentially happening in the future of sports. 
            By looking at upcoming advancements I was able to find the integration 
            of AI and holo tech as an upcoming trend. 
            So, then I could use these studies in our own project, 
            such as keeping athlete motivation and improving training efficiency. 
            Trend analysis provided the base for a concept that is not 
            only futuristic but also grounded in the potential 
            of current and upcoming technological trends.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Study 1 shows that they made footballers take penalties with VR-glasses.
            A camera can see your shot and instantly help you aim in the right direction. This resulted in a 35 increase of scoring possibility.

            Omega’s Swiss timing division is developing advance AI and computer vision systems to track and analyse Olympic athletes’ performances
            in real-time at the 2024 Paris Olympics, this includes motion sensors on athlete's clothing, 3D body imaging, 
            and algorithms tailored to each sport to provide detailed metrics and insights beyond just start and finish times.

          <p>
            This study gets into AI & VR how they are helping athletes reach their best performance. AI takes care of the data side, creating personalised training plans by analysing strengths and weaknesses, The VR part makes practice more real with simulations. Together, they offer a great combo for improving your own records and technique. 
            They also researched the best way to combine these two technologies to make it work more smoothly.

          <p>
            For the concept we made a running track, with a hologram projector, and an athelete that is running against a hologram.
            The hologram is a representation of the athelete's best time.
            so the athelete can see if he is running faster or slower than his best time.

          <p>
            For this project we had a presentation day in the form of a market.
            All the projects were presenting their stuf around the oil. And you could walk around
            and see all the projects. We had a lot of fun and we got a lot of good feedback.
            And for the presentation we made a video that shows what theme holosports will be in.
