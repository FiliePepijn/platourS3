          Holo Sports 2050
        </h1>
        <p class="intro" style="--index: 0; ">
          For the fast forward week we made Holo Sports, for this assignment I had to create something that will be revolutionary in the future. At first, we were struggling to pick between the sports, food and entertainment category.
          So, we looked at which one we liked the most and this was the sports category.

            In this section I will tell you how we started with the research and how we defined the problem.

            Trend Analysis <a target="_blank"  href="/docs/CBR/Partout-Debrief.pdf"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
          </h2>  
          <p>
            With the sports category in mind, I started doing research 
            on current problems in sports or things that can help an 
            athlete achieve better results. 
            I used trend analysis for this project to find upcoming 
            technologies that are potentially happening in the future of sports. 
            By looking at upcoming advancements I was able to find the integration 
            of AI and holo tech as an upcoming trend. 
            So, then I could use these studies in our own project, 
            such as keeping athlete motivation and improving training efficiency. 
            Trend analysis provided the base for a concept that is not 
            only futuristic but also grounded in the potential 
            of current and upcoming technological trends.

          <p>
            Study 1 shows that they made footballers take penalties with VR-glasses.
            A camera can see your shot and instantly help you aim in the right direction. This resulted in a 35 increase of scoring possibility.

            Omega’s Swiss timing division is developing advance AI and computer vision systems to track and analyse Olympic athletes’ performances
            in real-time at the 2024 Paris Olympics, this includes motion sensors on athlete's clothing, 3D body imaging, 
            and algorithms tailored to each sport to provide detailed metrics and insights beyond just start and finish times.

            This study gets into AI & VR how they are helping athletes reach their best performance. AI takes care of the data side, creating personalised training plans by analysing strengths and weaknesses, The VR part makes practice more real with simulations. Together, they offer a great combo for improving your own records and technique. 
            They also researched the best way to combine these two technologies to make it work more smoothly.

            In this section I will tell you how we came to the concept and how we started coding.
            When you have read this you will understand how we came to the conclusion and why.
            You will also read about what we used to make our website and all the steps that come with it.

            Creating the concept
          </h2>
          <p>
            For the concept we all came up with some functionality we wanted to see in the application.
            Application would be best suited to our problem. We wrote all our functionality down on a whiteboard. 
            We showed our idea to the client.
          </p>

          <h3> 
            Client's Feedback
          </h3>
          <p>
            The client liked the idea of creating video's for the driving students. And he also like the idea of making a way for students to track their progress.
            He wasn't quite sure about making it into a website, because when you look at the customer journey, it is better to make it more mobile accesible.
          </p>
          <p>
            After we got the feedback from the client we started to make a new concept.
            We made a new concept with the same functionality but now it was more mobile friendly.

            Website Design
          </h2>
          <p>
            When we had a clear concept, we started creating a desktop website design. <a class="link" href="">Figma</a>.
            In the picture you see the design I made of the website design. 
            I used a grid to get a more logical structure on the website. 
            Then I added the content in a sort of timeline, 
            this because then it is easy to read as you follow the step-by-step
            instructions and along as you scroll you get the sider that scrolls with you. 
            This will result in the way you can access links that come up in the step-by-step instructions.

          <h2> 
            Mobile Design 
          </h2>
          <p>
            For I also made the mobile design for the cbr project. The mobile desing is just a smaller version of the desktop design.
            I tried to make it as user friendly as possible. So I made the buttons bigger and the text more readable. and put the navbar at the bottom,
            this will add to a more mobile friendly experience. Because of the little amount of time I had to make the desing/wireframe. i didn't add all the screens and text but, this is what the
            mobile design would look like.

          <p>
            For the coding I made a Gitlab you can find this <a class="link" href="">Here</a>.  
            I also added a README file so you can see what the contents of the git are and how you can deploy the website, locally or publicly. I used just html CSS for my code because the page I wanted to make 
            doesn’t have any special animations. 
            And it doesn’t require anything to load.   
            I also commented my code so it is easier to read for other people.

          <h3>
            HTML Elements
          </h3>
          <p>
            For the HTML I used a lot of elements to make the structure of the website.
            The elements make the code easier to read and it will be easier to fint the right element.
            This also made it easier to style the elements with CSS.
