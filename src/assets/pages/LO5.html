          You are aware of your own strengths and weaknesses, 
          both in the field of ICT and in your personal development. 
          You choose actions in line with your core values to promote your personal 
          growth and develop your learning atitude.

            Specialization Choice
          </h2>
          <p>
            For my specialization i chose the smart mobile specialization.
            This semester i believe i really got better at creating code, i really like to create designs and be 
            apart of the final product. I think that the smart mobile specialization will be a great opportunity for me.
            I will learn how to create mobile apps and how to create a good user experience. 
            I think that this will be a great opportunity for me to learn more about the field of ICT and to develop my skills.
            For the design part i am really exited to learn more about how to create a good user experience
            on mobile devices, I think that this will be very important in the future because many companies
            are using or want to use apps.

            Dutch Design Week
          </h2>
          <p>
            Last year i went to the Dutch Design Week in Eindhoven.
            I went there with my friends and we had a great time. We saw a lot of cool designs and we got a lot of inspiration.
            This was a great opportunity to see wat other designers do and how they create their designs.
            On here are some pictures of the Dutch Design Week.

            Last year there was this exposition in Helmond organized by Clubzien.
            This exposition was for young students that got the oppportuntiy to make a exposition.
            The students got and assignemtn to choose paintings from the museum and conect it to their
            Topic. This was a great opportunity for me to see how the students did this and how they think 
            when they look at a painting or design. 
            The topics where very diverse and the students had a lot of different ideas.

          <p>
            I have also been to the Education Fair last year in september, here i asked questions at schools like fontys
            and TU/e about what they offer for media/ict students. I asked them if there was a specific study realted to
            UX design, and At TU delft they got this study called Human Centred design this was quite intresting. And
            The infor i got from this really helped me to get a better understanding of what i can do in the future.

          <h2>
            Passion Project Reflection
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Passion Project was an opportunity to explore 3D modeling 
            with Blender by creating a low-poly character model as proof 
            of learning. Starting with no prior experience, 
            I followed tutorials and sought additional 
            resources online to learn the fundamentals and resolve 
            challenges like crafting realistic facial features and 
            refining animation-friendly limbs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creative process involved designing clothes and 
            accessories that gave the character a unique personality. 
            While UV mapping for the body was successful, creating maps 
            for the apparel proved difficult and required restarting, 
            emphasizing the need for patience and planning.

          </p>

          <p>
            Feedback played a important role in improving my work, 
            from refining the model's topoligy to optimizing UV 
            mapping techniques. This experience taught me the importance 
            of precision, and collaboration. Moving forward, 
            I aim to improve my skills in UV mapping and animation while 
            spening more time to improve my projects.

          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the Passion Project was a rewarding experience that 
            blended creativity, technical learning, and problem-solving, 
            helping me grow as a 3D modeler.

            Semester Reflection
          </h2>
          <p>
            For this semester I think I really learned A lot, I learning more about being in a group
            Creating scrum plannigs, keeping tasks and taking care that everybody feels included during
            the project.
            <br>
            This semester I think i learned more about creating 3d modeling and development than i learned about
            UX & UI, maybe this is because i like to be busy with creating things and not so much with designing part of it.
            However i do really want to learn more about the design part, because there i can really make a difference.
            , When i make a design i always like it to check with people what there point of view is and what they think of it.
            So for the next semester in Smart mobile I will get more in to designing and creating a good user expereince.
            <br>
            For my development i think i really boosted my skills in creating 3d on websites with THREE.js.
            This was really cool to make and i enjoyed it a lot. I think that in the future
            i will use this more often because this is a great way to enchance the UI.
            By using 3d i can really create a unique joureny for the user and make the website more interactive.
