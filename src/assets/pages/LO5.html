          In the future I want to keep improving my development skills.
          I want to learn more about the latest technologies and how to use them.
          I also want to learn more about how people react to certain things and how I can use that in my projects.

          I have visited the Dutch Design Week in Eindhoven.
          There were a lot of cool art projects and I have learned a lot from them.
          In the UX design I have learned that you have to think about the user and how they will use the product.
          They also told the to get in to the users way of thinking.

          Strengths and weaknesses

        <p>
          To show my strengths and weaknesses I have made the my personality test.
          This test shows my strengths and weaknesses and how I can improve them.
          I am a ENFP-A type of person.
          This means that I am very enthusiastic and creative.
