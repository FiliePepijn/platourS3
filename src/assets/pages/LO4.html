          </h1>
          <p class="intro" style="--index: 2;">
            In our client project we used the Scrum method. 
            Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. 
            Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, 
            Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, 
            self-organize while working on a problem, 
            and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

            Roles
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 3;">
            In the Scrum method there are several roles. 
            The roles in our team are: Scrum master, Ux designer, Ui designer, Front-end developer, Client/Stakeholder.
            
            The Client/stakholder is responsible for providing the vision of the product and the requirements.
            The Scrum Master is responsible for taking care of every one doing their tasks and following 
            The scrum board for wich we used <a class="link" href="notion.so">Notion</a>.

          <p style="--index: 4;">
            For the our scrum I as scrum master had to plan the sprints and make sure that the team was on track.
            At first i had no idea how to make a sprint planning and assign the tasks to the sprints.
            So I aske a teacher for help and he helped me to make a sprint planning and how to assign the tasks to the sprints.

              <p>
                Voor het maken van een sprint planning kan je het project het best opdelen in 
                verschilldende onderwerpen van de double diamond.
                Dus verdeel de 12 weken over bijvoorbeeld 6 sprints.
                en ga dan kijken naar welk onderwerp je aan elke sprint koppelt.
                Dan kan je ook de deliverables voor elke sprint bepalen op deze manier 
                kan je de backlog en to-do list voor elke sprint opstellen.

              Double Diamond
            </h2>
            <p>
              To plan the sprints I used the double diamond methods as dirk sugested.
              The double diamond is a method to divide the project into different parts.
              The double diamond has 4 steps: Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver.

            For our group project I as scrum master am keeping in contact with the client.
            This mostly goes through <a class="link" target="_blank" href="/img/LO4/Client-Email.png">email</a> and sometimes through a meeting.
            The client is responsible for providing the vision of the product and the requirements.
            When we want to have a meeting as a group I send the client an e-mail with a RSVO link.
            This way we can easiliy plan a meeting with the client.

          <p>
            For the survey I made several questions in tally. 
            so, and got 27 responses to the survey.
            With this information we could pursue a problem definition, 
            and we now have a good look at what the problem is. 
            It is now easier to find a helpful solution.

            Feedback

          <p>
            I asked penny for feedback on the survey questions and she told 
            me that I should divide the theoretical exam questions from the 
            practical question since these are totally different cases.
            And that the practical exam can be influenced by the theoretical exam.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Reflection 
          </h3>
          <p>
            For the next survey I think it would be better to stick to google 
            docs although it has some limitations regarding the logic of the survey.
            Google forms have more export capabilities and is a lot more structured to find the right answer.

            Creating the concept
          </h2>
          <p>
            For the concept we all came up with some functionality we wanted to see in the application.
            Application would be best suited to our problem. We wrote all our functionality down on a whiteboard. 
            We showed our idea to the client.

            Client's Feedback
          </h3>
          <p>
            The client liked the idea of creating video's for the driving students. And he also like the idea of making a way for students to track their progress.
            He wasn't quite sure about making it into a website, because when you look at the customer journey, it is better to make it more mobile accesible.
            <a target="_blank" class="link" href="/docs/CBR/Client-Meeting.pdf">Client meeting </i></i> </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            After we got the feedback from the client we started to make a new concept.
            We made a new concept with the same functionality but now it was more mobile friendly.
            The mobile was a big part of the customer journey so we made it also availlable on mobile.
            When we had a concept i made a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="/docs/CBR/CBR-Concept.pdf">concept document </a>
