        <div class="intro-text">
          <h1>
            Solaria Design
          </h1>
          <p class="intro" style="--index: 2;">

            For the design studio all the members of our group made a logo, me as well. For the process of creating the logo I did the following. I am searching for inspiration which connects to our story. And because we stand for exploring the unexplored and for finding our spark I came up with the sun because of the name Solaria, the sun is in the solar system, and with a wave, because most people that explore things do this over sea. I combined this into each other and came up with the following:
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="logo" class="detail-text">
          <h2>
            Logo V1.0
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 3;">
            
            As you see I made the sun the centre of the logo. This is the most important part. It refers to solaria, and the sun is also in the centre of the solar system. To show that we at solaria design are adventures people i added the waves and mountains, this shows our love for exploring the unknown.
            I showed this logo to an expert and he told me that it is a clean but effective logo. But he found it a bit too much because of the icon in big as well as in the name. And with the first version of the logo, when you read the text you read “solaria find your spark design”. But it should be “Solaria Design”, “Find your spark”. 
          </p>
          
          <h2>Feedpulse</h2>
          <p>
            For the solaria logo i should look at how i position the slogan with the name, 
            otherwise it isn't that readable.
            For the icon, i dont have to put it everywere only on the full logo is enough, 
            the "o" of solaria doesn't have to be a icon. I also should keep the logo on a blue background.
          </p>

          <h2>

          </h2>
          <p style="--index:4">
            After I got this feedback I made a few changes to the design of this logo and it came out like this. I changed the O, i removed the icon, then i put design text in the middle and moved the slogan to the bottom of the logo.

              Brand Guide
          </h2>
          <p>
              For the brand guide one of the group members made 
              the <a target="_blank" class="link"  href="/docs/Solaria/BrandingGuide.pdf"> First Version </a>
              of the brand guide then we asked feedback on this. 
              Created the second version where the feedback is incorporated.
              The first version was created in adobe express; my group member made the
              brand guide on vertical document.
          </p>
  
          <h3>
              Feedback
          </h3>
          <p>
              We asked for feedback from dirk and told us that he liked the design 
              but that we should make the brand guide in adobe InDesign to keep the 
              logo on the same position in every page. He also had the idea to make the brand 
              guide horizontally because this would go better with our design style.
          </p>
  
          <p>
          </br>
              On the <a href="/docs/Solaria/BrandingGuide1.pdf" target="_blank" class="link" rel="noopener noreferrer">First iteration</a> of the brand guide, I made dirks ideas come to life with adobe InDesign, 
              it works great for making a sort of template (parent pages) to keep the consistency in every page.
              For this I also added the Logo do's and don'ts.
          </p>

              <p>
                  For this Feedback dirk Told me to make the do's and don'ts of the logo’s clearer.
                  He told me for example to add red crosses to make it clear that the user really should not use those.
                  So I added the red crosses and made the do's and don'ts more clear in the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="/docs/Solaria/BrandingGuide2.pdf">Second/final iteration</a>.

            <h2>

            <p>
              For the passion project I made a 3d model of a low poly character.
              I made this character in blender.
              For the whole model i made the body and the clothes.
              I also tried to do the UV mapping but this didn't go easy.
              I documented the process of creating the 3d model <a class="link" target="_blank" href="/docs/Passion-project/process.pdf">Here</a>
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 id="reflection">
              Passion Project Reflection
            </h2>
            <p>
              The Passion Project was an opportunity to explore 3D modeling 
              with Blender by creating a low-poly character model as proof 
              of learning. Starting with no prior experience, 
              I followed tutorials and sought additional 
              resources online to learn the fundamentals and resolve 
              challenges like crafting realistic facial features and 
              refining animation-friendly limbs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The creative process involved designing clothes and 
              accessories that gave the character a unique personality. 
              While UV mapping for the body was successful, creating maps 
              for the apparel proved difficult and required restarting, 
              emphasizing the need for patience and planning.
  
            </p>
  
            <p>
              Feedback played a important role in improving my work, 
              from refining the model's topoligy to optimizing UV 
              mapping techniques. This experience taught me the importance 
              of precision, and collaboration. Moving forward, 
              I aim to improve my skills in UV mapping and animation while 
              spening more time to improve my projects.
  
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, the Passion Project was a rewarding experience that 
              blended creativity, technical learning, and problem-solving, 
              helping me grow as a 3D modeler.
