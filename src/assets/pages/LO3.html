        <!-- solaria design -->
        <div class="intro-text">
          <h1>
            Solaria Design
          </h1>
          <p class="intro" style="--index: 2;">

            For the design studio all the members of our group made a logo, me as well. For the process of creating the logo I did the following. I am searching for inspiration which connects to our story. And because we stand for exploring the unexplored and for finding our spark I came up with the sun because of the name Solaria, the sun is in the solar system, and with a wave, because most people that explore things do this over sea. I combined this into each other and came up with the following:
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="detail-text">
          <h2>
            Logo V1.0
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 3;">
            
            As you see I made the sun the centre of the logo. This is the most important part. It refers to solaria, and the sun is also in the centre of the solar system. To show that we at solaria design are adventures people i added the waves and mountains, this shows our love for exploring the unknown.
            I showed this logo to an expert and he told me that it is a clean but effective logo. But he found it a bit too much because of the icon in big as well as in the name. And with the first version of the logo, when you read the text you read “solaria find your spark design”. But it should be “Solaria Design”, “Find your spark”. 
          </p>
          <div class="feedpulse">
            <h2>Feedpulse</h2>
            <p>
              For the solaria logo i should look at how i position the slogan with the name, 
              otherwise it isn't that readable.
              For the icon, i dont have to put it everywere only on the full logo is enough, 
              the "o" of solaria doesn't have to be a icon. I also should keep the logo on a blue background.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="detail-img">
          <img src="/img/LO1/LogOld.png" alt="Solaria Design">

        <div class="detail-img">
          <img src="/img/LO1/SolariaLogo.svg" alt="Solaria Design">

        <div class="detail-text">
          <h2>
            Logo V2.0
          </h2>
          <p style="--index:4">
            After I got this feedback I made a few changes to the design of this logo and it came out like this. I changed the O, i removed the icon, then i put design text in the middle and moved the slogan to the bottom of the logo.

        <!-- brandguide -->
        <div class="detail-text">
          <h1>
            BrandGuide
          </h1>
          <p class="intro" style="--index: 2;">
            For the brand guide one of the group members made the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="/docs/LO3/BrandingGuide.pdf">First version</a> of the brand guide then we asked feedback on this. I Created the second version where the feedback is added.
            The first version was created in adobe express, my group member made the brand guide on vertical document. Below you can see the feedgack i got from dirk.
          </p>

          <!-- feedpulse -->
          <div class="feedpulse">
            <h2>Feedpulse</h2>
            <p>
              We asked for feedback from dirk and told us that he liked the design but that we should make the brand guide in adobe indesign to keep the logo on the same position in every page. He also had the idea to make the brand guide horizontally because this would go better with our design style.
            </p>  
          </div>

          <h2>
            First iteration
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 3;">  
            On the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="/docs/LO3/BrandingGuide1.pdf">Second version</a> 
            of the brand guide I made dirks idea's come to life with adobe indesign, 
            it works great for making a sort of template (parent pages) to keep the consistency in every page.
            For this version I also added the Logo do's and don'ts.
          </p>
          
          <h2>
           Second iteration 
          </h2>
          <p style="--index:4">
            For this Feedback dirk Told me to make the do's and don'ts of the logo's more clear.
            He told me for example to add red crosses to make it clear that the user really should not use those.
            So based on the feedback I made the following version of the brand guide, 
            <a class="link" target="_blank" href="/docs/LO3/BrandingGuide2.pdf">third version</a>.
          </p>
