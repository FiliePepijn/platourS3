            For My portfolio I am making a website with a lot of information about me and my projects.
            I started of with making a design in figma. I made a design that is easy to read and has a lot of information.

          <h2>
            Gathering inspiration
          </h2>  
          <p>
            When I began designing my portfolio, 
            I wanted to create something that shows who I am, and I wanted it to give off 
            a professional vibe. To start the process, 
            I explored different websites to find elements that I liked. 
            Among the many sites I visited, 
            two stood out as particularly inspiring: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://prism-on.tokyo/prism/">PRISM</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.francobollimontilessini.com/poster/monte-tomba">Franco Bollimonti Lessini</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            From PRISM, I liked the use of big, playful links that lead to different pages. 
            These bold links brought fun and excitement to the site,
            making navigation feel like a modern web-experience rather than a basic
            professional design. I also liked how this approach was different from 
            traditional web designs, 
            so I wanted to make something like this way of navigation in my website.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
            For Franco Bollimonti I liked all the animations, 
            but particularly the text animation. 
            I did some research about these animations, 
            and it is part of the GSAP club program, 
            so I am not going to be able to use this in my final portfolio. 
            But here they also made use of the zoom scroll which I really like. 
          </p>

          <p>
            <br>
            At the end, my goal was to merge the aspects I loved from these 
            two websites—PRISM’s interactivity and Franco Bollimonti’s aesthetic
            with my own vision. By doing so,
            I made a portfolio that not only displays my skills but also 
            shows my personality in an authentic and engaging way.

            Choosing my Colors

            Next, I chose colours for my website. Picking the right colours is 
            important because they can make people feel different things when they look at my work.

          <h2> 
            Designing the layout
          </h2>
          <p>
            I started designing my portfolio in a program called Figma. 
            At first, I just made a rough design of where everything would go. 
            I showed it to my teacher for feedback.
            They told me it was a good start, 
            but I should focus on the structure for now because 
            I didn’t have all my content ready. 
            That made sense, so I kept it simple.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br>
            When I shared my design with another teacher, Dirk, 
            he gave me a helpful tip. He said, 
            “You should start with a wireframe.” 
            <a class="link" href="/docs/Portfolio/FeedPulse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="feedpulse2">(feedpulse 2)</a> 
            <br>
            A wireframe is like a simple sketch 
            of your website that shows how people will move through it. 
            This helps you focus on the layout before adding 
            colours and details.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="detail-text">
          <h2>
            Making a wireframe
          </h2>
          <p>
            To follow Dirk’s advice, I made a wireframe 
            on paper first. Drawing it on paper was fun 
            and let me try different ideas quickly. 
            I could move things around, erase parts I didn’t like, 
            and find the best way to organise my website. 
            It was like solving a puzzle!
            Once I was happy with my paper version, 
            I updated my design in Figma to match. 
            It felt much better now that I had 
            thought about how people would use my site.

          <h2>
            Playing with Colors
          </h2>
          <p>
            After the structure was done, I started experimenting with my colour palette. 
            I wasn’t sure which colour should go where, 
            so I made a few versions with different combinations. 
            Then I asked my classmates and friends for their opinions 
            through a Survey. I made the colour combinations 
            I thought look good and put all of them in a survey. 
            You can see these color combinations in the

            Their feedback really helped me pick the final design

            After I finished the design, 
            I started doing research for coding, 
            like which java script libraries were used in the websites 
            I used for inspirations. I Fastly found out that both sites, 
            PRISM and Franco Bollimonti Lessini, use GSAP. 
            I searched for the GSAP documentation for what 
            it is and how to use this in my portfolio. 
            I found out that GSAP is a animation library and you can do a lot with it. 
            You can animate anything with 
            GSAP from really easy animation to more complicated animations.

            When i was finisched with my small research about the GSAP, I started coding my Design.
            I started with making the landing page and animating the Big Text.

            For the code i will show you a part of the GSAP code here, and further you can see the full code in the
            GITLAB repository that i made. 
            You see a code snipet of my GSAP code here.
            Her i animated the P from the landing page to scale and become the bacground., at first this was quite the
            challenge but after some messing around with the code i got it to work.
