          after all the briefings the groups had to choose a client as stakeholder.

            After all the briefings I made a list of the clients that I liked the most.

          <p>
            After we heard that we got the CBR project from Partout. 
            We were excited to start creating and gathering research. 
            The first weeks were the most difficult because it was hard to make a beginning on the project, 
            we didn’t really know where to begin. But then we started with doing a debrief.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we got the Idea of what the assignment was, 
            we started doing research and asked ourselves 
            “what is the real problem that drives students don’t pass the exam.”
            We started doing research, for the research I made a 
            market analysis and made a survey for the target audience.

            After we got the briefing from Partout I made a debrief to get all the information in one document. 
            And sent it to the client to check in if our thoughts about the assignments matched. 
            The client reacted that the debrief was good and he had the same idea about the assignment.

          <p>
            I made the market analyis because it was important to know what the competitors are doing.
            And what the Keypoints of the CBR are.
            In the market analysis I wrote down what the most important things 
            are that we must process into our decisions when making content for the CBR.
            Because CBR is a government company it was a bit harder to make a detailed analysis.
            This is because there weren't many similar companies where I could relate to.

          <p>
            Good analysis, check with the other cbr group on 
            the competitive analysis to get a good view of how they made it. 
            A competitive analysis would be useful to get a real grip at what 
            other companies or countries are doing to the problems CBR are facing.

            For the survey I made several questions in tally. 
            so, and got 27 responses to the survey.
            With this information we could pursue a problem definition, 
            and we now have a good look at what the problem is. 
            It is now easier to find a helpful solution.

          <p>
            I asked penny for feedback on the survey questions and she told 
            me that I should divide the theoretical exam questions from the 
            practical question since these are totally different cases.
            And that the practical exam can be influenced by the theoretical exam.

            Reflection

          <p>
            For the next survey I think it would be better to stick to google 
            docs although it has some limitations regarding the logic of the survey.
            Google forms have more export capabilities and is a lot more structured to find the right answer.

            For the concept we all came up with some functionality we wanted to see in the application.
            Application would be best suited to our problem. We wrote all our functionality down on a whiteboard. 
            We showed our idea to the client.

          <p>
            The client liked the idea of creating video's for the driving students. And he also like the idea of making a way for students to track their progress.
            He wasn't quite sure about making it into a website, because when you look at the customer journey, it is better to make it more mobile accesible.
          </p>
          <p>
            After we got the feedback from the client we started to make a new concept.
            We made a new concept with the same functionality but now it was more mobile friendly.

            When we had a clear concept, we started creating a desktop website design. <a class="link" href="https://www.figma.com/design/cIDVTL08ZaEs46tQv9YMny/CBR-site?node-id=496-1252&t=87NSHWnzIsGsUMWM-1">Figma</a>.
            In the picture you see the design I made of the website design. 
            I used a grid to get a more logical structure on the website. 
            Then I added the content in a sort of timeline, 
            this because then it is easy to read as you follow the step-by-step
            instructions and along as you scroll you get the sider that scrolls with you. 
            This will result in the way you can access links that come up in the step-by-step instructions.

            For I also made the mobile design for the cbr project. The mobile desing is just a smaller version of the desktop design.
            I tried to make it as user friendly as possible. So I made the buttons bigger and the text more readable. and put the navbar at the bottom,
            this will add to a more mobile friendly experience. Because of the little amount of time I had to make the desing/wireframe. i didn't add all the screens and text but, this is what the
            mobile design would look like.

            I also added a README file so you can see what the contents of the git are and how you can deploy the website, locally or publicly. I used just html CSS for my code because the page I wanted to make 
            doesn’t have any special animations. 
            And it doesn’t require anything to load.   
            I also commented my code so it is easier to read for other people.

            HTML Elements

          <p>
            For the HTML I used a lot of elements to make the structure of the website.
            The elements make the code easier to read and it will be easier to fint the right element.
            This also made it easier to style the elements with CSS.

          <p>
            For our scrum board we use notion to keep track of our tasks. In the beginning of our project, we didn’t keep track of what sprint we were and what we should have done in each sprint. 

            I asked dirk what the best way is to set tasks for a sprint and decide 
            on what we as a group should do in a sprint.
            Dirk told me to divide all the tasks and 
            use the double diamond with discover <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>  define <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i>
            develop <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> deliver

        <div class="detail-text">
          <p>
            So, I divided every aspect of the double diamond into the weeks of our sprints (sprint of 2 weeks). For every sprint I make a sprint planning where I get tasks from the backlog and put them in our to do list. Then in the first sprint stand-up we assign the tasks.

            During the scrum period we did serveral retrospectives where we added the things we would like to keep add have less of and have more off, then we put them up on a board and discuss the cards. This was a fast and effective way to get an outcome.
