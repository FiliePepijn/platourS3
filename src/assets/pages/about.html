          On the following page you will read about my experiences this semester and what I have learned.
          I will also tell you about what I am proud of and what my roadmap is for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this semester I think I really learned A lot, I learning more about being in a group
            Creating scrum plannigs, keeping tasks and taking care that everybody feels included during
            the project.
            <br>
            This semester I think i learned more about creating 3d modeling and development than i learned about
            UX & UI, maybe this is because i like to be busy with creating things and not so much with designing part of it.
            However i do really want to learn more about the design part, because there i can really make a difference.
            , When i make a design i always like it to check with people what there point of view is and what they think of it.
            So for the next semester in Smart mobile I will get more in to designing and creating a good user expereince.
            <br>
            For my development i think i really boosted my skills in creating 3d on websites with THREE.js.
            This was really cool to make and i enjoyed it a lot. I think that in the future
            i will use this more often because this is a great way to enchance the UI.
            By using 3d i can really create a unique joureny for the user and make the website more interactive.
