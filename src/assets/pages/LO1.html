          </h1>
          <p class="intro" style="--index: 2;">
            For the fast forward week we made Holo Sports, for this assignment I had to create something that will be revolutionary in the future. At first we were struggling to pick between the sports, food and entertainment category.
            So we looked at which one we liked the most and this was the sports category. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="holo-discover" class="detail-text">
          <h2>
            Discover 
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 3;">
            With the sports category in mind I started doing <a href="/docs/LO3/HoloSports.pdf" target="_blank" class="link">Reserach</a> on current problems in sports or things that can help an athlete achieve better results.
            I looked at google scholar research for problems in sports. But I didn't really find anything.
          </p>
          <p style="--index: 4;">
            But then I thought of using AI and Holograms in sports. The idea is that you can race against your hologram. This will keep you motivated to continuously break your own records.
            And you can race against other athletes as well to see if you can beat the best of the best.
          </p>
          <h3>Trend Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            With the sports category in mind, 
            I started doing research on current problems in sports or things that can help an athlete achieve better results. 
            I used  <a href="/docs/LO1/trend-analysis.pdf" class="link" target="_blank" class="link">trend analysis</a> for this project to identify upcoming technologies that are potentially happening in the future of sports.
            By looking at upcoming advancements I was able to find the integration of AI and holo tech as an upcoming trend. 
            So, then I could use these studies in our own project, 
            such as maintaining athlete motivation and improving training efficiency. 
            Trend analysis provided the base for a concept that is not only futuristic but also grounded in the potential of current and upcoming technological trends.

            The idea behind Holo Sports is to create a training tool where you can race against a hologram of yourself. This solution stimulates athletes to perform better to break their own records, and with the holograms they can see their own progress improving. By seeing their personal best in a hologram, athletes can look at ways to perform even better.
            Holo Sports offers an opportunity to compete against holograms of other athletes. For example, an athlete can run against the hologram of Usain Bolt. This way they can learn from the super athletes and improve their own tactics as well.

          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 5;">
            To bring this vision to life, we started by sketching the concept to explore how the idea could be used best practically. Once the design was done, I used the laser cutter available in the makerspace to create the track. 
            This went very well, and we were quite fast at making the whole track with hologram projectors. The result is a prototype that shows the concept’s functionality and how the idea is used in sports training. It is a visual of how holo sports can improve the whole sports training program.

          </h1>
          <p class="intro" style="--index: 2;">
            For the portfolio assignment I had to create a portfolio that shows my work and who I am. I started with the design of the portfolio. I wanted to make it look clean and professional. In this section I will show you how I created my portfolio and explain the choises i made.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Inspiration
          </h2>
          <p class="intro" style="--index: 3;">
            When I began designing my portfolio, I wanted to create something that shows 
            who I am and I wanted it to give off a professional vibe. 
            To start the process, I explored different websites to find elements that I liked. 
            Among the many sites I visited, 
            two stood out as particularly inspiring: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://prism-on.tokyo/prism/">PRISM</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.francobollimontilessini.com/poster/monte-tomba">Franco Bollimonti Lessini</a>.

          </p>
          <p>
            From <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://prism-on.tokyo/prism/">PRISM</a>, I liked the use of big, playful links that lead to different pages. 
            These bold links brought fun and excitement to the site, 
            making navigation feel like a modern web-experience rather than a basic professional design. 
            I also liked how this approach was different from traditional web designs, 
            So i wanted to make something similar to this way of navigation in my website.
          </p>
          <p>
            For <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.francobollimontilessini.com/poster/monte-tomba">Franco Bollimonti Lessini</a> I liked all the animations, but particularly the text animation. 
            I did some research about these animations, and it is part of the GSAP club program 
            so I am not going to be able to use this in my final portfolio. 
            But here they also made use of the zoom scroll which I really like. 
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end, my goal was to merge the aspects I loved from these two websites <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://prism-on.tokyo/prism/">PRISM's</a> 
            interactivity and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.francobollimontilessini.com/poster/monte-tomba">Franco Bollimonti Lessini</a>’s aesthetic with my own vision. 
            By doing so, I made a portfolio that not only showcases my skills but 
            also shows my personality in an authentic and engaging way.

            Next, I chose colours for my website. Picking the right colours is 
            important because they can make people feel different things when they look at my work. 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lUJ0idMpxbTaoDOCkipwMJRsJC0PTFsjuc4KpvLph00/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="link"></a> Here you see the colors I picked and why i picked them.

            <p style="--index: 2;">
              After creating the wireframe and choosing the colors I started with the design of the portfolio. I used the colors from the color scheme. 
              The design proces was really fun and easy to do because I had a clear vision of what I wanted to make.
              I only got stuck on the color combination of what collor should be the background and what color should be the text.

          <p>
            For the Client project we got our preference, of all the clients.
            We had to watch several presentations of projects we could do, 
            and one of those was the CBR project. 
            I like this project the most because when I first heard it, 
            I liked that it was about the UX, and 
            I really like to do user tests and make seamless website experiences.
