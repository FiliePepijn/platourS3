          </h1>
          <p class="intro" style="--index: 2;">
            For the fast forward week we made Holo Sports, for this assignment I had to create something that will be revolutionary in the future. At first we were struggling to pick between the sports, food and entertainment category.
            So we looked at which one we liked the most and this was the sports category. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="holo-discover" class="detail-text">
          <h2>
            Discover 
          </h2>
          <p style="--index: 3;">
            With the sports category in mind I started doing <a href="/docs/LO3/HoloSports.pdf" target="_blank" class="link">Reserach</a> on current problems in sports or things that can help an athlete achieve better results.
            I looked at google scholar research for problems in sports. But I didn't really find anything.
          </p>
          <p style="--index: 4;">
            But then I thought of using AI and Holograms in sports. The idea is that you can race against your hologram. This will keep you motivated to continuously break your own records.
            And you can race against other athletes as well to see if you can beat the best of the best.
          </p>
          <h3>Trend Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            With the sports category in mind, 
            I started doing research on current problems in sports or things that can help an athlete achieve better results. 
            I used  <a href="/docs/LO1/trend-analysis.pdf" class="link" target="_blank" class="link">trend analysis</a> for this project to identify upcoming technologies that are potentially happening in the future of sports.
            By looking at upcoming advancements I was able to find the integration of AI and holo tech as an upcoming trend. 
            So, then I could use these studies in our own project, 
            such as maintaining athlete motivation and improving training efficiency. 
            Trend analysis provided the base for a concept that is not only futuristic but also grounded in the potential of current and upcoming technological trends.

            The idea behind Holo Sports is to create a training tool where you can race against a hologram of yourself. This solution stimulates athletes to perform better to break their own records, and with the holograms they can see their own progress improving. By seeing their personal best in a hologram, athletes can look at ways to perform even better.
            Holo Sports offers an opportunity to compete against holograms of other athletes. For example, an athlete can run against the hologram of Usain Bolt. This way they can learn from the super athletes and improve their own tactics as well.

          <p style="--index: 5;">
            To bring this vision to life, we started by sketching the concept to explore how the idea could be used best practically. Once the design was done, I used the laser cutter available in the makerspace to create the track. 
            This went very well, and we were quite fast at making the whole track with hologram projectors. The result is a prototype that shows the concept’s functionality and how the idea is used in sports training. It is a visual of how holo sports can improve the whole sports training program.

            I wanted to create something that shows who I am, and I wanted it to give off 
            a professional vibe. To start the process, 
            I explored different websites to find elements that I liked. 
            Among the many sites I visited, 
            two stood out as particularly inspiring: <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://prism-on.tokyo/prism/">PRISM</a> and <a target="_blank" class="link" href="https://www.francobollimontilessini.com/poster/monte-tomba">Franco Bollimonti Lessini</a>.

          <h2> 
            Designing the layout
          </h2>
          <p>
            I started designing my portfolio in a program called Figma. 
            At first, I just made a rough design of where everything would go. 
            I showed it to my teacher for feedback.
            They told me it was a good start, 
            but I should focus on the structure for now because 
            I didn’t have all my content ready. 
            That made sense, so I kept it simple.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br>
            When I shared my design with another teacher, Dirk, 
            he gave me a helpful tip. He said, 
            “You should start with a wireframe.” 
            <a class="link" href="/docs/Portfolio/FeedPulse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="feedpulse2">(feedpulse 2)</a> 
            <br>
            A wireframe is like a simple sketch 
            of your website that shows how people will move through it. 
            This helps you focus on the layout before adding 
            colours and details.

        <div class="detail-text">
          <h2>
            Making a wireframe
          </h2>
          <p>
            To follow Dirk’s advice, I made a wireframe 
            on paper first. Drawing it on paper was fun 
            and let me try different ideas quickly. 
            I could move things around, erase parts I didn’t like, 
            and find the best way to organise my website. 
            It was like solving a puzzle!
            Once I was happy with my paper version, 
            I updated my design in Figma to match. 
            It felt much better now that I had 
            thought about how people would use my site.

            For the Client project we got our preference, of all the clients.
            We had to watch several presentations of projects we could do, 
            and one of those was the CBR project. 
            I like this project the most because when I first heard it, 
            I liked that it was about the UX, and 
            I really like to do user tests and make seamless website experiences.

          <p>
            After we got the briefing from Partout I made a debrief to get all the information in one document. 
            And sent it to the client to check in if our thoughts about the assignments matched. 
            The client reacted that the debrief was good and he had the same idea about the assignment. 
            Here is a link to the <a class="link" href="/docs/CBR/Partout-Debrief.pdf">Partout presentation debrief</a>.
            When we got the Idea of what the assignment was,
            we started doing research and asked ourselves
            “what is the real problem that drives students don’t pass the exam.”
            We started doing research, for the research I made a market analysis and made a survey for the target audience.

            I made the market analyis because it was important to know what the competitors are doing.
            And what the Keypoints of the CBR are.
            In the market analysis I wrote down what the most important things 
            are that we must process into our decisions when making content for the CBR.
            Because CBR is a government company it was a bit harder to make a detailed analysis.
            This is because there weren't many similar companies where I could relate to.

            Good analysis, check with the other cbr group on 
            the competitive analysis to get a good view of how they made it.

            For the survey I made several questions in tally.

            me that I should divide the theoretical exam questions from the 
            practical question since these are totally different cases.
            And that the practical exam can be influenced by the theoretical exam.

            Reflection

          <p>
            For the next survey I think it would be better to stick to google 
            docs although it has some limitations regarding the logic of the survey.
            Google forms have more export capabilities and is a lot more structured to find the right answer.

            In the picture you see the design I made of the website design. 
            I used a grid to get a more logical structure on the website. 
            Then I added the content in a sort of timeline, 
            this because then it is easy to read as you follow the step-by-step
            instructions and along as you scroll you get the sider that scrolls with you. 
            This will result in the way you can access links that come up in the step-by-step instructions.

            This mobile design is a bit different from the desktop design. the navbar is at the bottom and there are some different changes.
